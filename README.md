## Project Description

This project is a basic example of a loading bar animation. It consists of an HTML file (`index.html`) and a CSS file (`style.css`) that define a loading bar and a text element displaying "Loading...". The loading bar changes colors and moves from left to right in a continuous loop to give the illusion of loading.

## File Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: This is the HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage, including the loading bar and the text element.
- `style.css`: This CSS file defines the styling and animations for the loading bar and text.
- `README.md`: The README file you are currently reading, which provides information about the project.

## Usage

To use this loading bar animation, follow these steps:

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the loading bar animation. You can do this by double-clicking the `index.html` file or by using a local development server.

3. The loading animation will run in a continuous loop, changing colors and giving the appearance of a loading process.

## Customization

You can customize this loading bar animation to suit your needs. Here are some customization options:

- **Duration and Speed**: You can adjust the duration and speed of the loading animation by modifying the keyframes in the `style.css` file. The keyframes for the loading animation are defined under `@keyframes load`. You can change the percentage values and colors to customize the animation's appearance and duration.

- **Text Content**: You can change the text content displayed during the loading animation by modifying the `<p>` element in the `index.html` file with the class `text`.

- **Styling**: You can modify the styling of the loading bar and container by adjusting the CSS properties in the `style.css` file. For example, you can change the container's background color, shadow, or the loading bar's height.
